CPyCppyy: Python-C++ bindings interface based on Cling/LLVM
===========================================================

CPyCppyy is the CPython equivalent of cppyy in PyPy.
It is a CPython extension module built on top of the same backend API as
PyPy/cppyy.
It thus requires the installation of the
`PyPy cppyy backend <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyPy-cppyy-backend/>`_
for use.
CPython/cppyy and PyPy/cppyy are designed to be compatible, although there
are differences due to the former being reference counted and the latter
being garbage collected.

Read the `full documentation <http://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/cppyy.html>`_
over on `pypy.org <http://pypy.org>`_.
